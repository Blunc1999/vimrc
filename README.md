# My Custom Vimrc


## Where to put my vimrc file?
According to vim official recommendation, which you can check through `:help vimrc` in vim.

	Places for your personal initializations:
		Unix		$HOME/.vimrc, $HOME/.vim/vimrc
				or $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/vim/vimrc
		MS-Windows	$HOME/_vimrc, $HOME/vimfiles/vimrc
				or $VIM/_vimrc
		Amiga		s:.vimrc, home:.vimrc, home:vimfiles:vimrc
				or $VIM/.vimrc
		Haiku		$HOME/config/settings/vim/vimrc

	The files are searched in the order specified above and only the first
	one that is found is read.

	RECOMMENDATION: Put all your Vim configuration stuff in the $HOME/.vim/ directory ($HOME/vimfiles/ for MS-Windows). That makes it easy to copy it to another system.


## How to install?
### Install for your own user only
To install it simply do following from your terminal:

	git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/Blunc1999/vimrc.git ~/.vim_runtime
	sh ~/.vim_runtime/install_Linux.sh

### Install for multiple users
To install for multiple users, the repository needs to be cloned to a location accessible for all the intended users.

	git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/Blunc1999/vimrc.git /opt/vim_runtime
	sh /opt/vim_runtime/install_Linux_parameterized.sh /opt/vim_runtime user0 user1 user2
	# to install for all users with home directories, note that root will not be included
	sh /opt/vim_runtime/install_Linux_parameterized.sh /opt/vim_runtime --all
	
Naturally, `/opt/vim_runtime` can be any directory, as long as all the users specified have read access.


## Fonts

I recommend using [IBM Plex Mono font](https://github.com/IBM/plex) (it's an open-source and awesome font that can make your code look beautiful). The Awesome vimrc is already setup to try to use it.

Some other fonts that Awesome will try to use:

* [Hack](http://sourcefoundry.org/hack/)
* [Source Code Pro](https://adobe-fonts.github.io/source-code-pro/)+
* [JetBrainsMono](https://github.com/JetBrains/JetBrainsMono/)


## How to update to latest version?

Just do a git rebase!


    cd ~/.vim_runtime
    git reset --hard
    git clean -d --force
    git pull --rebase
    python update_plugins.py  # use python3 if python is unavailable
